This folder contains sql files for "optional" covariates. That is, these
covariates will be prioritized and some will be dropped. The user needs to
populate a table of the following format:


    CREATE TABLE #dim (
        person_id bigint,
        covariate_id varchar,
        covariate_count int)
    ;

The use should _not_ create this table (it is created already before the sql in
this file is executed) and the user should not drop/truncate it afterwards. The
user is free to create any other temporary tables as necessary, but those need
to be dropped by the user when finished.
