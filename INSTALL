Installing this requires the R package devtools. The packages devtools and hdps
can be installed by running the following commands inside R:

> install.packages("devtools")
> library("devtools")
> install_github("ApproximateIdentity/hdps")

If you want to make any changes to the software, instead clone the repo using
git. This can be done by running the folling command at a terminal ("command
line"):

> git clone https://github.com/ApproximateIdentity/hdps.git

Next start up R and set the current working directory to the hdps folder
created in the previous step and then run the following commands:

> install.packages("devtools")
> library("devtools")
> install()

Load the package with library("hdps") and you don't get an error you should be
all set.

Note that if you have make installed, you can use make to do this. Run

> make

at the command line to uninstall and reinstall hdps. Run

> make uninstall

to uninstall hdps and run

> make reinstall

to reinstall it.
