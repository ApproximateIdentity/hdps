This is an (actively developing) implementation of the High Dimensional
Propensity score algorithm in the R language. It is part of the OHDSI project
(see ohdsi.org and the OHDSI/* github repositories) and depends upon much of
the code which has been writtn by that team.

As of the writing of this README, the majority of this repository's code is
simply a subset of the code written by OHDSI (especially by Patrick Ryan,
Martijn Schuemie, and Marc Suchard). All originality is theirs and all mistakes
are mine.
