Important:
* Is outcomes is sparse...is that okay?
* Implement minPatients
* Double-check that algorithm actually does what it's supposed to do.
Especially check that the logic in prioritizeOptCovariates is correct!

Less important:
* Write documentation
* Add verbose/quiet options in generateDataFromSql
* Reorder functions to make more sense
* Do error checking at beginning of covariateGeneration
* Change dataGenerators to only read .sql files and put READMEs in the folders
* Make names of functions match names in paper

Optimizations:
* Change compute priority on per-dimension basis to decrease memory load

Pre-release:
* Update references to "ApproximateIdentity" to "OHDSI" in INSTALL whenever
that move occurs...

Overall questions:
* What is results_schema?
* Is outcomes format correct? Should there be multiple outcomes?
* How to handle excluded persons? Probably run cohorts and outcomes at once? Is
this even something I should care about?
