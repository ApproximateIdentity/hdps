* Double-check that algorithm actually does what it's supposed to do
    -- Drop covariate if fewer than 100 patients have it
    -- Prioritize covariates and add dropping criterion
* Add cutoff functionality to generateCovariatesFromData
* Check if dependencies still hold
* Write documentation
* Add verbose option
* Reorder functions to make more sense
* Do error checking at beginning of covariateGeneration
* Change the dimension sql files to use sql render.
* Make names of functions match names in paper
* Use dbSendQuery plus fetch (or whatever it's called) to avoid dataframe
* Do cutoff within each dimension
* Change cohorts to persons in data generators
* Check code for inconsistencies in naming 'covariatesdir' vs 'covariatedir'
* What is results_schema?
* Is outcomes format correct? Should there be multiple outcomes?
* How to handle excluded persons? Probably run cohorts and outcomes at once?
